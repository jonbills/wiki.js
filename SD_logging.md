# SD Card logging
Logging of data to an SD card is currently under development and supports Teensy based systems only. 

## Requirements
* Teensy based Speeduino ECU (Eg Dropbear)
* 4gb minimum SD card. 250mb must be free on this to begin a logging session
* SD card must be formatted with the ExFAT filesystem. Speeduino uses certain features of ExFAT that are not available on FAT16/32
