Overview
--------

This a 24 tooth wheel with 12 wide teeth and 12 narrow teeth. The narrow provides 3 degrees of pulse while the wide provides 12. All of the falling edges are 15 degrees apart. This decoder uses the falling edges, requiring the cam signal to determine crank angle.

> The "Dual wheel" decoder set to 24 teeth and `FALLING` edge should be used. The dedicated 24X decoder should not be used for the moment
