Overview
--------

There are two signals one from the crank wheel and the other from the cam. The crank wheel puts out a series of four pulses every 120 degrees. Each of the four pulses is 20 degrees apart and lasting only 2 degrees. The cam wheel pluses once every 360 degrees or 720 crank degrees. The pulse last for 180 degrees or 360 crank degrees.
