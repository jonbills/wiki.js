# Dropbear ЭБУ
Dropbear представляет собой ЭБУ с 8 каналами впрыска и 8 каналами зажигания. Использует высокоскоростную плату Teensy 3.5 и представляет собой готовое устройство в корпусе. 

## Features

- 8x high impedance injector drivers
- 8x 5v/12v coil pre-drivers (For use with igniters/smart coils)
- 6x medium current (2A) outputs
- 7x analog inputs
- 4x digital inputs
- CAN transceiver
- Onboard VR conditioner
- Swappable internal MAP sensors
- Onboard baro sensor
- Optional stepper motor driver

## Board Configuration
The Dropbear board contains 4 switches and 1 DIP switch pair that can be used to change the setup of the ECU. 

### Crank/Cam inputs
The ECU contains a dual onboard conditioner that can can be used with VR sensors. The selection between Hall/Optical sensors and VR sensors is made via a pair of switches, one each for the crank and cam. These can be selected independently for setups that use one of each sensor type. 

When set for Hall sensors, this input will work with both the traditional ground switching sensor (the pullup resistor is on the board and does not need to be added) or a 0-12v signal as used on some GM vehicles. 

### MAP Selector
The Dropbear board uses a removable MAP card containing the sensor and a short hose running to the bulkhead connector on the enclosure. Currently only the default 0-250kpa sensor board is available, with higher range boards to be made available in the future. To use this MAP card, select the `Int.` (Internal) option on the MAP switch. 

If you wish to use an external MAP sensor located in the engine bay, this switch should be to to `Ext.` and the sensors signal line should be connected to pin `C8` on the Black connector. The MAP card can be left in place or removed when the `Ext.` option is used. 


## Pin out

The Dropbear ECU uses 2x 24 pin Delphi Sicma connectors. The connectors are keyed and will only connect to the matching colour loom plug.
