## Warmup curve
The Warm Up Enrichment (WUE) curve represents the additional fuel amount to be added whilst the engine is coming up to temperature (Based on the coolant sensor). The final value in this curve should represent the normal running temperature of the engine and have a value of 100% (Representing no modification of the fuel from that point onwards).
